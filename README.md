# zonefab
A `SimpleNameZone` and `SimpleNameZoneFactory` for creating zones to be used within [dmap](https://github.com/dapphub/dmap).

For more detail, see https://github.com/ricobank/how-to/blob/master/make-a-namezone.md.

Repo is just a sketch and will likely be improved.

`SimpleNameZoneFactory` is currently deployed on mainnet at `:free.zonefab`, or `0xa964133b1d5b3ff1c4473ad19be37b6e2aade62`


### Test
Tests against forked mainnet so we don't have to mimic dmap. Run like:

`forge test -f {YOUR_RPC_URL}`
